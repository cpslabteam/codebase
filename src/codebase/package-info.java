/**
 * A library of general purpose utility classes.
 * <p>
 * The fundamental idea of <tt>codebase</tt> is to avoid replicating basic utility
 * functionality over and over again. In practice, programmers often need to replicate the
 * code of utility classes and, moreover, have a tendency to regard this code as of lesser
 * importance. An obvious consequence is that these classes don't get as thoroughly tested
 * as they often should, often compromising code quality.
 * <p>
 * One of the main goals of <tt>codebase</tt> is to put gather functionality that are
 * commonly used in the code to avoid that each project/developer to implement its own
 * version and have it throughly tested.
 * <p>
 * The main goals of <tt>codebase</tt> are to:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Contributing to increasing the overall code quality by offering a library of high
 * quality utility classes (tested and revised)</li>
 * <li>Simplifying the dependencies of applications (using <tt>codebase</tt> prevents
 * depending on other libraries)</li>
 * <li>Setting a minimum standard for code quality (the code is available in open source
 * to be analyzed).</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * The classes included in the main package are general purpose classes used for, among
 * other, parsing command line arguments, file handling, ciphering, string and binary
 * operations. Utility classes for more <i>specialized functionality</i> are organized
 * into <i>appropriate sub-packages</i>.
 * <p>
 * Some design notes:
 * <ol>
 * <li><tt>codebase</tt> should have <b>no dependencies</b> other that Java base libraries
 * </li>
 * <li>Unless otherwise stated, the classes herein are not threaded safe without external
 * synchronization.</li>
 * <li>The classes included in the main package are general purpose classes used for,
 * among other, parsing command line arguments, file handling, ciphering, string and
 * binary operations.</li>
 * <li>Utility classes for more specialized functionality are organized into appropriate
 * sub-packages.</li>
 * <li>All the code undergoes strict static checking and most of it is unit tested for
 * maximum reliability.</li>
 * <li>Methods are carefully documented</li>
 * <li>Compatible with Java 1.6 to be easily embbedable</li>
 * <li>Codebase can be used as an OSGi bundle.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * Other open source alternatives to <tt>codebase</tt> are
 * <a href="http://commons.apache.org">Apache Commons</a> and
 * <a href="https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries">Google Guava</a>. Although similar
 * in spirit, we decided to keep maintaining <tt>codebase</tt> because it has a lower
 * footprint and better suited to our purposes.
